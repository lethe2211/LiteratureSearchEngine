Table 1: The size distribution of the strongly connected components

Figure 3: User activity. The user activity measured by how many
tweets or unique URLs the user posted. For both metrics, the user
activity is power-law distributed (dotted line: / x−1.25 ).

Figure 4: URL popularity. URL popularity measured by the number of tweets and number of unique users that mentioned the URL. In
both cases we obtain the power-law distributions, / x−1.3 for tweets
and / x−1.45 for unique users.
Retweets. Often when users tweet a URL that was
found in another user’s feed, they give credit to the original URL poster. This phenomenon became known as
retweeting [4]. If @bob wants to give credit to @alice,
he prepends her message with RT @alice: followed
by the text of the original tweet of @alice. RT stands
for re-tweet. We only focus on the tweets containing

between the user first hears about a URL from one of the followees
until the moment the user tweets about that URL. The fit is ln N (µ

There are approximately 700k positive and 9M negative entries in the training data set with 500k unique users
and 50k unique URLs. The test data set has 5.2k URL
mentions that need to be predicted.
Models. Our evaluation covers the following models

linear threshold model, LTr
